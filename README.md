## 🔰 Getting Started

### 🔍 Step 1. Install [Eask CLI](https://github.com/emacs-eask/cli)

Download binaries from their [release page](https://github.com/emacs-eask/cli/releases)
, and extracted somewhere on your machine. Then add the path `/path/to/eask/`
to environment `PATH`, so you can access it anywhere.

For more installation options, see https://emacs-eask.github.io/Getting-Started/Install-Eask/.

> ⚠ Warning
>
> Make sure the executable `eask` has the permission to execute! Use `chmod`
> command if needed!

### 🔍 Step 2. Install `Easky` (this package)

#### package.el

This package is available from [JCS-ELPA](https://jcs-emacs.github.io/jcs-elpa/).
Install from these repositories then you should be good to go!

Normally, you don't need to add `(require 'easky)` to your configuration since
most `easky` commands are autoloads and can be called without loading the module!

#### use-package

If you use [use-package](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UsePackage), add the
following to your `init.el` file:

```elisp
(use-package easky :ensure t)
```

or with `straight.el`:

```elisp
(use-package easky
  :straight (easky :type git :host github :repo "emacs-eask/easky"))
```

#### Manual installation

Copy all `.el` files in this repository to `~/.emacs.d/lisp` and add the
following:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
(require 'easky)
```
